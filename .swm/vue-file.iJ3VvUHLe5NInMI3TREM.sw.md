In this app we use the most common way to structure components - Single file components.
A `.vue` file consist of 3 main tags:  
* `<template>`- The template tag contains the component’s HTML markup.
* `<script>` -  The script tag contains the component’s JavaScript code. Within this tag we can do things like import other components, or other packages we need for our component to work.
* `<style>` -  The style tag contains all of our component’s rules for styling said component (CSS).
