In this unit we will walkthrough Vue router and how we can use it.
[Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) is the official router for Vue.js. It deeply integrates with Vue.js core to make building Single Page Applications with Vue.js a breeze.

<br/>

In this step we create a file for the router, import the `vue` instance and set it to use `VueRouter` (`vue-router` should be installed)
We also import the Vue components that will be displayed for the routes.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ src/router/index.js
```javascript
ðŸŸ© 1      import Vue from 'vue';
ðŸŸ© 2      import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
ðŸŸ© 3      import Home from '../views/Home.vue';
ðŸŸ© 4      import About from '../views/About';
ðŸŸ© 5      
ðŸŸ© 6      Vue.use(VueRouter)
â¬œ 7      
```

<br/>

In this step we are declaring what component (from the imported components) will be showed for each rout path.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ src/router/index.js
```javascript
â¬œ 12     }
â¬œ 13     
â¬œ 14     const routes = [
ðŸŸ© 15       {
ðŸŸ© 16         path: '/',
ðŸŸ© 17         name: 'Home',
ðŸŸ© 18         component: Home,
ðŸŸ© 19       },
â¬œ 20       {
â¬œ 21         path: '/about',
â¬œ 22         name: 'About',
â¬œ 23         component: About
â¬œ 24       },
```

<br/>

We create and export an instance of the router.
Read about [history mode](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html)
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ src/router/index.js
```javascript
â¬œ 30       },
â¬œ 31     ]
â¬œ 32     
ðŸŸ© 33     const router = new VueRouter({
ðŸŸ© 34       mode: 'history',
ðŸŸ© 35       base: process.env.BASE_URL,
ðŸŸ© 36       routes
ðŸŸ© 37     })
ðŸŸ© 38     
ðŸŸ© 39     export default router
```

<br/>

The component will be rendered where the `<router-view>` tags are declared. In this app we have only one router view, but it is possible to have more than one.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ src/App.vue
```vue
â¬œ 4          <navdrawer :menu-items="menuItems" />
â¬œ 5          <v-main>
â¬œ 6            <v-container fluid>
ðŸŸ© 7              <router-view @updateItems="updateItems"></router-view>
â¬œ 8            </v-container>
â¬œ 9          </v-main>
â¬œ 10     
```

<br/>

In the app we have a menu that triggers the routing
The `:to` attribute is bind to the value of `item.route`,  and on click it will navigate to the path and the corresponding component will be showed.
There are special tags to declare a vue-router link `<router-link to="/about">Navigate to About </ router-link>`. The Vuetify components that we are using act as router links and that is why we don't need to use these tags in this case.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ src/components/Navdrawer.vue
```vue
â¬œ 10         <v-divider></v-divider>
â¬œ 11     
â¬œ 12         <v-list dense nav>
ðŸŸ© 13           <v-list-item link v-for="item in menuItems" :key="item.title" :to="item.route">
â¬œ 14             <v-list-item-icon>
â¬œ 15               <v-icon>{{ item.icon }}</v-icon>
â¬œ 16             </v-list-item-icon>
```

<br/>

In this step we setting the values for the menu, including the route path.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ src/App.vue
```vue
â¬œ 41         },
â¬œ 42         setMenuItems() {
â¬œ 43           this.menuItems = [];
ðŸŸ© 44           this.menuItems.push({ title: "Home", icon: "mdi-home", route: "/" });
â¬œ 45           this.menuItems.push(
â¬œ 46             ...this.items.map((rootItem) => {
â¬œ 47               return {
```

<br/>

Vue Router has a lot to offer, including dynamic routing, nested routing, 404 handling and more.
In our app we use the router to decide what component should be displayed for each route.
